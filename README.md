# HLA-and-A004-trial
This repository includes all code needed to generate signficant results reported in Nelson et al., 
"Prediction of differential Gag vs Env responses to a mosaic HIV-1 vaccine regimen by HLA class I alleles". 
The essential analysis is performed in the functions in:  "PCA function.R", "allele assoc functions.R", 
and "VL v janssen response functions.R"
  The code assumes that the data and functions are in directories under a directory named "HLA_A004".
